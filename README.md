Understanding who your customers are ‚Äî and how they behave ‚Äî is the foundation of effective marketing. These projects explore:

- Identifying distinct customer groups based on behavioural patterns and purchasing signals
- Predicting customer actions using classification and regression models
- Generating insights to support personalised campaigns, strategic targeting, and lifecycle management

Outcome: Better audience segmentation, tailored experiences, and improved ROI on outreach strategies.

Customer relationships don‚Äôt end at acquisition. These projects help uncover what keeps users engaged and what drives long-term value:

- Analysing key engagement metrics and behavioural triggers linked to retention
- Modeling data to extract product trends and preferences and how these link to engagement
- Providing actionable recommendations to boost retention, satisfaction, and loyalty


Outcome: Data-led strategies to reduce attrition and nurture high-value relationships.

- Analysing conversion funnels and user flow drop-offs
- Forecasting growth trends and consumer demand using time series models
- Simulating business scenarios to support strategic planning and marketing investment decisions

Outcome: Clear visibility into growth opportunities, enabling teams to test, prioritise, and scale the most impactful actions.

‚öôÔ∏è **Tools & Techniques**
My work leverages Python, SQL, machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, XGBoost, Keras), and visualisation tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), alongside marketing-focused metrics and experimental design (A/B testing, uplift modelling, cohort analysis).

üí° **Why It Matters**
In today‚Äôs data-rich environment, businesses need more than dashboards, they need clear, forward-looking answers. This portfolio is built to demonstrate how data science can bridge the gap between raw information and smart commercial decisions.

Whether it's optimising campaign targeting, boosting retention, understanding sentiments, or mapping customers journeys, each project tells a story: how data can be turned into strategy.
